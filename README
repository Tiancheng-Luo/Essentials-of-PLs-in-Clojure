# EssentialsOfProgrammingLanguages

I bought the book to learn about Programming Languages. I really look forward to reading this book and implement the examples in Clojure as far as that is possible. I hope I can learn more about PLs and Clojure. I'm happy for any feedback on my code.

## Usage

Look at it :)

## Installation

Run "lein deps"
